### Main Game

Once you've selected your characters, you can begin the main game. In the middle of the screen is the game board, with coloured tokens representing the players. On the left is the current player's inventory and the information sheet. The bottom right holds the movement, dice, and turn controls. If the end turn button is pressed, the inventory and information sheet will swap over as soon as the next player confirms they are ready. When you enter a room, you can use the top right section to suggest or accuse a suspect. Unique sound effects will also play whenever you enter a room or roll the dice.
